# 👨‍💻 Welcome to Dave's GitHub!

Hi there! I’m **Davide Castaldi**, a **Computer Engineer** passionate about development of experiences across Apple’s ecosystem. For the past **two years**, I’ve been honing my skills as part of the **Apple Developer Academy**, where I’ve explored and mastered development across **iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, iPadOS**, and the groundbreaking **visionOS** platform.

## 🛠️ **What I’ve Done**  
### Year 1: Comprehensive Apple Ecosystem Development  
During my first year at the Academy, I dove deep into the development process for:  
- **iOS**: Swift apps with beautiful and accessible user interfaces.  
- **macOS**: Leveraging macOS-specific capabilities for desktop applications.  
- **watchOS**: Apps focused on minimalistic interfaces and context-aware notifications.  
- **tvOS**: Big-screen experiences tailored for media consumption.  
- **iPadOS**: Harnessing the power of the larger canvas with Pencil support.
- **visionOS**: Created my first project ever.

Many of the apps developed on these platforms are on the store!

## 🌟 **What I’m Doing Now**  
### Year 2: Specialized Training in visionOS (AR/MR/VR/XR)  
I’m currently focused on **visionOS**, Apple’s newest frontier for **spatial computing**. My projects revolve around:  
- Designing intuitive **spatial user interfaces and experiences**.  
- Building immersive **3D experiences** with **RealityKit**.  
- Pioneering **augmented, mixed, virtual and extened reality** solutions for next-generation apps.

## 🏅 **My greatest achievements**    
There are **2 Apps** that have been my greatest, along with a **visionOS framework**:

- **Astral Wilds** an app developed for **visionOS**
This project allows the user to be at the center of the solar system and experience a travel to Mars
